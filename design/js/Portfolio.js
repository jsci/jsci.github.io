		  description: "I selected a letter written by Laura Huxley, wife of the famed novelist Aldous Huxley of Brave New World. As a writer fascinated and renown for his interest in psychedelic drugs and Parapsychology, Aldous is quoted by his wife Laura in this letter that describes his last few days before death. The letter explains his state while given numerous medication and during his last few hours before death, he was given LSD.
 
		  Set as 6 &#215; 9 inches, the book's layout is an octagon wing, to represent the last eight days Aldous was in his deathbed.
 
		  The spot color chosen for this book is scarlet, as described as Huxley as a bright, shining color (next to yellow) that gives hope because, unaccountably, the mind responds to them.

		  The book jacket with the book title, subtitle, and author printed on a vellum overlaying the copyright information printed onto the book cover.

		  Throughout the book before Aldous dies, he talks to Laura with struggle as he faces death. His speech throughout the book is inconsistent. Which is why I chose Electra for the body text and Brandon Grotesque to complement it. Dala Floda was the other typeface chosen which was originally based off of gravestone writing.

		  As a secondary text, I chose to include medical definitions that described the medicine and its severe side effects. I represented this through prescription notes printed on vellum. Throughout the letter Laura Huxley administers Aldous with numerous kinds of drugs to treat his medical conditions. Yet during the time of the 60's, medication at the time generally had severe side effects similar to drugs. This only made his condition worse. Whenever Laura gave him medicine in the letter, I inserted a presciption note. At the same time, I manipulated the body text to react to the severe side effects of the drug as if the text was administered the drug."

		  description: "My task was to create a new logotype for the online clothing store, Honest by. The Honest by company operates, with a 100% transparency policy. The company offers products with complete transparency in their price and manufacturing, creating a “new paradigm in fashion and retail” to create innovative and sustainable clothing.
 
		  They continuously offer new collections and share their goals with other established and upcoming designers with many features. This spreads the idea of being honest with one another as well as to their audience.

		  The finished logotype is a product that utilizes negative space, subtle-ness, and simplicity. The green thread is sewn through the word “honest” locking in the honest policies of Honest by through the clothing. It also connects the “honest” to the “by” to represent the blank after the “by” that is reserved for the designers who pledge to fabricate clothing that is 100% transparent and natural. The thread does its job weaving together designers to collaborate in Honest by’s goal of creating high end sustainable fashion.
 
		  The double stitch represents the top stitch detail fashion designers use to finish their garments and add detail and care into their work. It represents Honest by’s policy to give their audience finished pieces constructed with fabric and thread with nothing to hide."

		  description: "This assignment involved pathfinding to created a map that visually explains how to transport a large, unwieldy 63-inch sphere between specific locations with several waypoints in the Massachusetts College of Art and Design campus. This was a team project of 4 members who had to analyze the campus and create a print-based document that contained elements of wayfinding, user experience, sequencing, and information design all in a hierarchical sense to represent time, distance, scale, and action in the most understandable way.
 
		  For this project, my team members and I decided to create an interactive printed map to help engage users into their journey. We used a tab language to help the users understand actions with a minimal use of words to convey our message."

		  description: "Based on the First Things First manifesto, I created a set of two posters with a multimedia piece to accompany the set. My take on the manifesto concentrated on the value of the dollar the designer would take to produce quality design work. A true designer would design for good rather than the amount they earn.
 
			The concept behind the posters are based on the dollar and hundred dollar bill. Underneath the money reveals the true intent of the design and asks the question, is the design honest or deceptive?"

Each recipe card is systematically paired with weather and seasons that correlate to the type of food the recipe card makes. A system is represented through weather icons that appears on the back of the recipe card. The key can be found on the packaging. For example, the lemon inspired soup such be eaten on a cold, winter day."
