        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
        <p>I was interested in looking at the locations of the users on Dribbble. I wanted to follow patterns of which users are posting at what frequency that is interrlated to where they are posting from.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&mdash; Posting frequency</li>
            <li>&mdash; Seasons and holidays</li>
            <li>&mdash; Timezones</li>
            <li>&mdash; Date of registration</li>
            <li>&mdash; Areas of popularity</li>
        </ul>
