      <p>Asiana Food Market is a family owned small business located in East Providence, RI. We sell various east Asian products, specifically Korean and Japanese foods. We are proud to be one of the very few Asian specialty stores in Rhode Island. Focusing on authentic products, it is considered one of the best Rhode Island local stores. We are proud to offer a large selection of specialized foods and a variety of brands that is difficult to find anywhere else. From the freshly made Korean side dishes known as banchan (반찬) to more exotic things such as mochi, we are deticated to serving our customers 
      and to help them find what they need.</p>
